## 🏆 Featured Projects

### 🧬[Genomics Annotation Service using Amazon Web Services](https://github.com/mxu2000/genomics-annotation-service)

#### Overview
The Genomics Annotation Service is a cloud-based platform designed to leverage the power of Amazon Web Services, including EC2, DynamoDB, Glacier, SQS, SNS, and SES, to provide a robust genomic annotation service.

#### Key Functions
- **User Authentication:** Secure login through Globus Auth with tiered access for Free and Premium users.
- **Account Upgrades:** Option for Free users to upgrade to Premium for access to enhanced features and capabilities.
- **Annotation Job Submission:** Ability to submit genomic annotation jobs with size restrictions for Free users, while Premium users can submit jobs of any size.
- **Real-Time Notifications:** Users receive email alerts upon completion of annotation jobs, complete with log file access and results download links.
- **Data Management and Retrieval:** A user-friendly interface to browse job history, with immediate results download for Free users post-job completion, and persistent access for Premium users.

### 🍴[Food Accessibility and Security in Cook County](https://github.com/mxu2000/food_accessibility_project)

#### Overview
According to the United States Department of Agriculture, food insecurity is “a household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food” (USDA). The project centers on Cook County and uses data from Yelp Fusion’s API, scraped emergency pantry data from the Sheriff’s Office’s, and downloaded demographic data from the US Census Bureau.

For the project, my teammates and I built a dashboard in order to visualize and explore patterns between the following key components affecting food insecurity:
- **Food Access (Proximity to food)**
- **Food Quality**
- **Food Type**
- **Restaurant Cleanliness**
- **Socioeconomic Factors**

Since 1 in 4 children in Cook County are at risk of hunger, we hope that our application can help educate people about food accessibility as it is a critical health issue.

### 🩻 [Predicting Pneumonia from X-Ray Image](https://github.com/mxu2000/cappydoctors-pneumonia-diagnosis)

#### Overview
In this project, my teammates and I developed a deep learning algorithm to diagonalize pneumonia from chest x-ray images of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center. After conducting an in-depth literature review, we performed image augmentation to obtain a balanced dataset and then used PyTorch to build a 3-layer convolutional neural network (CNN). To further improve the accuracy of our model, we performed a series of hyperparameter tuning, including different dropout rate, training epochs, learning rate, and additional layers. During the experiments, we customized a 3-layer model, which achieved an accuracy of 93.75% and a recall of 100%, and identified overfitting as our main challenge.
