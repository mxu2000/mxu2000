## üèÜ Featured Projects

### üß¨[Genomics Annotation Service using Amazon Web Services](https://github.com/mxu2000/genomics-annotation-service)

#### Overview
The Genomics Annotation Service is a cloud-based platform designed to leverage the power of Amazon Web Services, including EC2, DynamoDB, Glacier, SQS, SNS, and SES, to provide a robust genomic annotation service.

#### Key Functions
- **User Authentication:** Secure login through Globus Auth with tiered access for Free and Premium users.
- **Account Upgrades:** Option for Free users to upgrade to Premium for access to enhanced features and capabilities.
- **Annotation Job Submission:** Ability to submit genomic annotation jobs with size restrictions for Free users, while Premium users can submit jobs of any size.
- **Real-Time Notifications:** Users receive email alerts upon completion of annotation jobs, complete with log file access and results download links.
- **Data Management and Retrieval:** A user-friendly interface to browse job history, with immediate results download for Free users post-job completion, and persistent access for Premium users.

### üìä[DataForGood-Chicago: A Data Analysis and Visualization Tool](https://github.com/uchicago-capp-30320/DataForGood-chicago)

#### Overview
The main objective of our web application is to help small and medium-sized nonprofits collect, analyze, and use Census data efficiently to achieve their goals. By using advanced technologies like Python, GIS mapping, and data science techniques, including natural language processing and AI, the application will allow nonprofits to easily access and use the city's resources and information, plan strategically, and make data-driven decisions without needing extensive technical skills. Overall, the application aims to bridge the gap between data availability, accessibility, and its effective utilization by nonprofit organizations. It seeks to empower nonprofits to make informed decisions, optimize resource navigation and allocation, and enhance their impact on the communities they serve.

#### Key Components
- **Data and Dashboard:** Select variables and indicators for analysis, generate interactive visualizations, and customizable dashboards for comprehensive insights.
- **Automated Memo Generation:** Summarize key insights from data and visuals, generate ready-to-use memos or paragraphs.
- **Maps and City Resources:** Explore and navigate city resources using integrated ArcGIS Online functionality.

### üç¥[Food Accessibility and Security in Cook County](https://github.com/mxu2000/food_accessibility_project)

#### Overview
According to the United States Department of Agriculture, food insecurity is ‚Äúa household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food‚Äù (USDA). The project centers on Cook County and uses data from Yelp Fusion‚Äôs API, scraped emergency pantry data from the Sheriff‚Äôs Office‚Äôs, and downloaded demographic data from the US Census Bureau.

For the project, my teammates and I built a dashboard in order to visualize and explore patterns between the following key components affecting food insecurity:
- **Food Access (Proximity to food)**
- **Food Quality**
- **Food Type**
- **Restaurant Cleanliness**
- **Socioeconomic Factors**

Since 1 in 4 children in Cook County are at risk of hunger, we hope that our application can help educate people about food accessibility as it is a critical health issue.

### ü©ª [Predicting Pneumonia from X-Ray Image](https://github.com/mxu2000/cappydoctors-pneumonia-diagnosis)

#### Overview
In this project, my teammates and I developed a deep learning algorithm to diagonalize pneumonia from chest x-ray images of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children‚Äôs Medical Center. After conducting an in-depth literature review, we performed image augmentation to obtain a balanced dataset and then used PyTorch to build a 3-layer convolutional neural network (CNN). To further improve the accuracy of our model, we performed a series of hyperparameter tuning, including different dropout rate, training epochs, learning rate, and additional layers. During the experiments, we customized a 3-layer model, which achieved an accuracy of 93.75% and a recall of 100%, and identified overfitting as our main challenge.
